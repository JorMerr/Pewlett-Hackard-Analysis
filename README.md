# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees at Pewlett-Hackard by title, and identify all employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program aimed at training new hires to replace those retiring. Due to the large number of retirees the upcoming situation has been labelled the "silver tsunami".

## Summary

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

	- There is an estimated 72,458 roles which will need to be filled to replace all vacancies caused by the "silver tsunami".



- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

	- From the pool of active employees born in the year 1965, there is an estimated 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship. This number is far below the projected estimate of retiring employees, and there would be sufficient employees to train replacements. 
	- It may be prudent, however, to expand the mentorship pool to include employees born in years other than 1965 to ensure enough employees are mentored to fill the bulk of vacated positions due to the "silver tsunami".
