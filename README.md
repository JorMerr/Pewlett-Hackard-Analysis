# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees at Pewlett-Hackard by title, and identify all employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program aimed at training new hires to replace those retiring. Due to the large number of retirees the upcoming situation has been labelled the "silver tsunami".

## Results

- The largest number of anticipated retiring employees by title are Senior Engineers (nearly 26,000) and Senior Staff (nearly 25,000).

- The smallest number of anticipated retiring employees by title are Managers (only 2 listed).

- The number of current employees at Pewlett-Hackard born in 1965 who are eligible for the mentorship program as Engineers are 429. These employees may be suitable to replace vacant Senior Engineer positions.

- In order to fill all positions which may be left vacant from the "silver tsunami", the mentorship program may be required to expand its eligibility criteria beyond those active employees born in 1965.

## Summary

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

	- There is an estimated 72,458 roles which will need to be filled to replace all vacancies caused by the "silver tsunami". The count of employees Pewlett-Hackard anticipates to retire in the "silver tsunami" based on title can be seen below:

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

	- From the pool of active employees born in the year 1965, there is an estimated 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship. This number is far below the projected estimate of retiring employees, and there would be sufficient employees to train replacements. 
	- It may be prudent, however, to expand the mentorship pool to include employees born in years other than 1965 to ensure enough employees are mentored to fill the bulk of vacated positions due to the "silver tsunami". The count of active employees born in 1965 at Pewlett-Hackard who are eligible for the mentorship program can be seen below:
